# VBA_Challenge

#VBA of Wall Street

##Overview of Project: 

###Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve expand the dataset to include as much data from the stock market from the previous years. VBA, or Visual Basic Application, will be used to code thousands of stocks. VBA id normally used to automate tasks and perform other functions in office programs; in this case the focus is on Excel. VBA is used to automate repetitive and frequent tasks and to make coding more structured. The goal in this analysis is to be able to improve the coding to make it more efficient when putting it to run; it would allow it to run faster, use less memory and make it more comprehensive for future users. 

##Results: 

###Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

In this analysis, we are comparing how the stock performed for two years, 2017 and 2018 based on the total daily volume and the yearly return for each stock. The daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day measuring how often a stock is traded. As for the yearly return, it is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The return is the investment made from beginning of the year to the end without having sold the stock; it shows how much the investment increased or decreased by the end of the year. In the 2017 All Stocks Analysis, it demonstrates the growth of the stock investments by the end of the year for all except TERP which shrunk by 7.2%. As for the 2018 All Stocks Analysis,  it shows all stocks shrunk by the end of the year, with the exception of two stocks, ENPH and RUN, which increased by 81.9% and 84.0%, respectively. 

##Summary: 

###In a summary statement, address the following questions.

	####What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
	
	Code refactoring is used to improve quality and make existing code more efficient without changing its' functionality. Codes should be refactored in cases where the codes need to be improved, to make the codes easier to understand, where coding can be written incorrectly and bugs are raised. It is important to refactor code for programming that will be used permanently for other users to be able to understand and work more efficiently. Refactoring would be a disadvantage in cases where there is not enough time or money to complete. 

	####How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
In this module, there were more advantages to refactoring this dataset than disadvantages. Refactoring the code listed in this VBA script allowed there to be better formatting; the coding after the refactoring was easier to understand and more clean and thorough. However, as efficient as it makes the coding from the original script, it becomes more complex, specially as a beginner coder, where the issues are not visible.
